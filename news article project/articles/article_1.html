    <h3>What is Computer Programming and How to Become a Computer Programmer?</h3>
    <p align="left">Computer programming is the process of writing code to facilitate specific actions in a computer, application or software program, and instructs them on how to perform. Computer programmers are professionals that create instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully.</p>

    <p align="left">Computers can do amazing things, from basic laptops capable of simple word processing and spreadsheet functions to incredibly complex supercomputers completing millions of financial transactions a day and controlling the infrastructure that makes modern life possible. But no computer can do anything until a computer programmer tells it to behave in specific ways. That's what computer programming is all about.</p>
    <p align="left">At its most basic, computer programming is little more than a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions. Based on the requirements or purposes of these instructions, computer programming can be as simple as adding two numbers. It can also be as complex as reading data from temperature sensors to adjust a thermostat, sorting data to complete intricate scheduling or critical reports or taking players through multi-layered worlds and challenges in games.</p>
    <p align="left">Dr. Cheryl Frederick, executive director of STEM programs at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), said computer programming is a collaborative process, with a variety of programmers contributing during the development of a piece of software. Some of that development can last decades. For software like Microsoft Word released in 1983, for instance, programmers have been tweaking and improving it for years.</p>
    <p align="left">"The hope is that the computer program will become such a widely adopted system that it needs long-term support, particularly to extend its current functionality," Frederick said. "The terms computer software and computer programming are used interchangeably except software can get rather large."</p>
    <h1>What Do Programmers Do All Day?</h1>
    <p align="left">Computer programmers create instructions for a computer to execute by writing and testing code that enables applications and software programs to operate successfully. Computer programmers use specialized languages to communicate with computers, applications and other systems to get computers and computer networks to perform a set of specific tasks. Languages like C++, Java, Python and more allow programmers - often working closely with software developers and engineers to build programs that allow “search, surfing and selfies,” according to ComputerScience.org.</p>
    <p align="left">There are many programming languages but some have emerged as the most popular. CareerKarma listed the most common programming languages in 2021 based on job openings.</p>
    <h2>How Do You Become a Computer Programmer?</h2>
    <p align="left">Many computer programmers begin as self-taught enthusiasts, and a persistent interest in programming can be an asset in your career because continued learning is vital to a computer programmer.</p>
    <p align="left">In 2021 the median salary for computer programmers was $93,000 according, to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and to enter the field, a bachelor's degree is typically required.</p>
    <p align="left">"Getting a degree is a good way to get started in a career, and it gives you a foundation to organize your experiences," said Curtis George, a computer science technical program facilitator at SNHU. "Ultimately though it's the experience that makes you a great programmer. In addition to having experience, a successful programmer always keeps up with the latest computer languages, algorithm processes and software industry trends."</p>
    <p align="left">Frederick agreed. She held jobs with the Department of Defense and in the financial and telecommunications sectors before turning to education. “It takes a lot of grit and it's not enough to earn a degree; you need workplace experience,” she said. “We give students a foundation - based on data structures, algorithms, math and logical engineering - but you have to be able to plan, write, design, test and manage software. You have to know at least two or three programming languages, including proficiency in JAVA and C++.”</p>
    <p align="left">Beyond classroom and experiential learning, however, computer programmers must understand that when writing a program, it never works the first time. </p>
    <p align="left">“This field requires patience, and the ability to troubleshoot and get at errors. You need to be a learning worker, be self-disciplined, have the motivation to learn on your own, be able to brainstorm with others, and have a lot of hands-on practice,” Frederick said. “You must be a practitioner and adapt to what’s trending.”</p>
    <p align="left">While working to complete a computer science degree, students are encouraged to create a portfolio of their software work. “Though this portfolio isn’t graded, students can share it with potential employers as proof of coding capabilities,” Frederick said. “The entire degree program gives students broad exposure and proficiencies in traditional and trending technologies, including such specialties as computation graphics, software testing and writing code for commonly used programs, as well as deeper, more specific skills.”</p>
    <h2>Is it Worth Getting a Programming Certificate?</h2>
    <p align="left">While most computer programming positions require at least a bachelor's degree, many advanced degree programs are also available. In addition to those academic avenues, there are dozens of professional and nonprofit professional certifications available. BLS notes that certifications exist for specific programming languages and that some employers may require programmers to become certified in the products the company uses.
    </p>
    <h2>Learn Software Engineering</h2>
    <p align="left">George was previously employed by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other high-tech leaders, and has been integral to the development of the university's computer science curriculum.</p>
    <img src="../pictures/curtisgeorge.png" align="right">
    <p align="left">“In my jobs, I trained a lot of junior software engineers, and I would stand behind them, show them parts of code and, by giving them hands-on experience, they would eventually get better,” said George. “Having a basic knowledge of software programming, including working with others (on) teams, is a good starting point for any job.”</p>
    <p align="left">In pursuing a computer science degree with a focus on software engineering, it's important to learn in a collaborative environment, whether in-person or virtually, as these experiences will mirror what will be expected in the workplace. George noted that students learn computer programming and build software in online labs that provide independent work opportunities along with team collaboration.</p>
